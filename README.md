# NKAD
Neighbor Knowledge-aware Detector for Graph Anomaly Detection

Use the following command to run the main script with configuration options:

```bash
python3 main.py --dataset $dataset_name --device $gpu_id
```
We support using datasets from [data](https://github.com/pygod-team/data). You can download these datasets and place them in the data directory `data`. 
Alternatively, you can run the code directly, and the dataset will be downloaded automatically.
